      "prompt": "A large-format oil painting that fuses Abraham van Beyeren banquet still-life language with geometric abstraction and systems-art. Foreground: a monumental Atlantic lobster, silver platter, overturned roemer glass, peeled lemon spirals, grapes, oyster shells, and tarnished pewter in ultra-real Dutch brushwork. Midground fractures into De Stijl planes and translucent cubist shards, as if the still life is being decomposed into mathematical structure. Background carries subtle chalked entropy equations and recursive lattice motifs, integrated into paint texture (not literal text overlays). Lighting is dramatic Dutch chiaroscuro from upper left, with spectral cyan edge-light from an unseen modern source. Mood: opulent, unstable, contemplative. Museum-grade, richly layered, original hybrid style. No watermark, no typography, no modern logos.",

A lobster sits among fruit, shells, bread, and silverware on velvet drapery; every object is rendered with old-master realism at center, while outer zones dissolve into kinetic brushstrokes, contour maps, and generative topology-like arcs. Include tiny reflective highlights that hint at modern circuitry embedded in the metal surfaces, but keep period authenticity dominant. Palette: deep umber, vermilion, indigo, antique gold, with controlled neon accents. Composition should feel like 17th-century still life colliding with 21st-century computational aesthetics. Deep, poetic, non-cartoon, no text, no watermark.",

Across the scene, softly integrated translucent geometry and attention-field halos suggest invisible thought vectors moving through space. Keep anatomy and domestic objects physically believable, but let the composition include subtle surreal echoes (mirrored perspective fragments, repeated claw contour at varying scales) to imply recursive perception.
